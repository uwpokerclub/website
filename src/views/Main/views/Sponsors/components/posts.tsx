          Jane Street is a quantitative trading firm that uses innovative
          technology, a scientific approach and a deep understanding of markets
          to guide our business. The markets change rapidly, and we need to
          change faster still. Every day, we come to work with new problems to
          solve, new systems to build and new theories to test. We’re always
          looking for people to join us and help come up with that next great
          idea.

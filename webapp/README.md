## Installation

Before starting development or usage of the frontend app, ensure you have all of the prerequiste software installed below.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (with Docker Compose)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local development environment using:

```sh
# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/uwpokerclub/app.git
# SSH
git clone git@github.com:uwpokerclub/app.git
# GH CLI
gh repo clone uwpokerclub/app

# Change into project directory
cd app
## first time installation
npm install
```

## Development

### Starting the app

To start the app for local development you can run the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

**_Note: If you are working on the admin portion of the app, you will also need to have the [API server](https://github.com/uwpokerclub/api) running locally as well._**

This will start the React development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The development server will also hot reload for almost all code changes so you can continue to develop without restarting the application.

### Running tests

To run tests, run the following command:

```sh
npm test
```

## Production

To build a production ready version of the application, you can build the Docker image with the Dockerfile provided in this repository. This will internally run `yarn build` which will create a production ready build of the React app, and copy the build files into a thin nginx image.

```sh
docker build .
```
